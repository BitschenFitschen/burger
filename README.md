# burger
A create a burgger-logger made with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebards and ORM. We followed a MVC deisgn pattern and use fof Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Whenever a user submits a burgers name, the app will display the burger on the page, under the area of 'waiting to be devoured'. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button.
